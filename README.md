# Get My Time Back

This is a learning app to limit time spent on specific websites.

It uses the Accessibility Service. I initially thought this would be better than using a service like a VPN, Network or something like that, but because Accessibility is a very sensitive permission, it was tricky to use it and keep the app running properly, at least on my phone. These are the steps I had to take:

- Allow the Accessibility Service for the app, of course, lol
- Disable the battery saver option for the app, because it was killing the background process
- Enable the popup (overlay) permission in the other permission options in the app settings. This is needed so the app can appear over the browser when time is up.

The app works well, except that from time to time, it seems my phone stops the background service, and to fix it, I usually have to clear the appâ€™s data and re-enable the permissions.
(It has to be ways to mitigate this, I guess)

Hey, but besides all the bad things, this app has helped me cut down my time spent on social media to 20 minutes a day (except on the days I have to reset the permissions, lol, but it's still far less than before I had the app).

The app doesn't have any persistent layer, so if you reboot your phone or clear the app data, the counter will start again. So, youâ€™ll need some willpower to keep yourself accountable. Also, if you use a browser that isnâ€™t listed in `MyAccessibilityService.kt`, the app wonâ€™t track itâ€”so more willpower needed here, lol.

## How it works

The Accessibility Service tracks your browser current tab, and if the website is one of those listed in `app/src/main/assets/blocked_sites.json`, it starts counting.  
Once your time is up, the app blocks access to the website until the next day. The counter resets at 3 a.m. This way, I canâ€™t just wait until midnight to browse again ðŸ§ 

## How to use it

- Update `app/src/main/assets/blocked_sites.json` with the websites you want to track and the allowed time
- I always installed the app directly from Android Studio to my phone, but if you want  
  to build the app, you can use `./gradlew assembleRelease` (tested on Mac)
- I only used it with Chrome (but I guess it works with other browsers too)

## Permissions

- **Accessibility Service:** Required to monitor browser activity.
- **SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW:** Used to display overlays when time limits are reached.
